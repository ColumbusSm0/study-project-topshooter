# study-project-topshooter
Welcome to my Unity Engine study project! This repository houses a single project in which I experiment with various Unity tools and features. The project doesn't follow a clear design direction; rather, it focuses on hands-on learning and scripting by implementing different features and functionalities. While the content might seem experimental and somewhat unstructured, my aim is to keep it well-organized and, hopefully, interesting.

# Features
Scripting: Implementing gameplay mechanics using C# scripts.
Physics: Exploring Unity's physics engine for movements and interactions.
Animations: Creating and managing character and object animations.
UI/UX: Designing and integrating user interfaces and user experience elements.
Audio: Adding and managing sound effects and music.
Shaders and Materials: Customizing visuals with shaders and materials.
Effects and Particles: Creating effects and visual assets with .vfx unity tool.
Scene Management: Structuring and organizing game scenes.
